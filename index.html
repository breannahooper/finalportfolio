        <p>In this project, I was becoming introduced to coding's very basic properties. I created a website introducing myself to the class and included some of my goals and interests.</p>

        <h3>The Art vs the Artist</h3>

              </div>
     </a>
        <p>Within this website is some of my favorite pieces of art. I struggled with some of the main properties of coding, such as creating texts to fit a certain size, but I did become more familiar with adding photos and creating buttons. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        <h3>Testing buttons...</h3>

              </div>
     </a>
        <p>With my "branching" website, I experimented with buttons that take you through different paths. I stayed on the basic side of designing in order to focus my attention on getting the links right. I experimented with colors and fonts for the first time, and this project will help me in the future to customize my websites more.

    <div class="col-sm-4">
           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">With Phase 1, I learned a lot of basics. I learned how to make a website and the further I got into the projects, the more I learned about making them your own. Putting a lot of my own art work into my projects made me think of future goals where I can create websites developing my creative skills as well as advertise myself and my art out into the real world. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">During Phase 1, I struggled a lot. The process of code and building websites is something I have never experimented with. I found myself frusterated and lost in the beginning. But, throughout the sharing process with others in the classroom, I was able to learn some skills from my peers. They were able to help  me troubleshoot some of my errors and alieviate some of my frusterations. </p>
        </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">These projects were out of my comfort zone,but I pushed myself to learn the basic techniques and useful skills to have while creating in this class. I have put time and effort into creating these sites and had to really think about what I was going ot make and how I was going to do it. I used a lot of my own work as well as experimented with some new work to create my projects in Phase 1. </p>

        <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Throughout this experience, I have learned a lot. There was times where I stared at my computer and had no idea what I was doing. It took a lot of time for me to create even the most basic website, but I challenged myself to overcome the frusterations and try to keep learning. I used ChatGPT to help troubleshoot some of my code. I also rewatched the tutorials as many times as I could until I got some of the basics down. By the end of Phase 1 I was able to create something I wouldn't of been able to prior to this class. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">Usually if I am not confident in my work, I tend to hide it. But in this class I realized it is all about growth and pushing boundaries. Sharing and presenting my work with others in the class has helped me learn some things from others as well as be more confident in the fact that I can only get better. </p>

         </a>
            <p>Creating a photo essay allowed me to begin experimenting with video. For this specific project, I struggled with uploading to YouTube in the correct format. It uploaded as a 360 degree video and I could not figure out how to change it. But, this problem did not occur with any of my other projects</p>
        </div>

                  </div>
         </a>
            <p>For this video, I explored animating texts. I followed the YouTube tutorial, and found myself re-watching the video over and over. I eventually figured out how to get it right, but it did take some time paying attention to what buttons do what.</p>

                 </div>
        </a>
           <p>This project was my very first project exploring moving text. I used the phrase "Just Breathe", with an animation similar to the feeling of taking a breath, in order to give a relaxing sensation. This project was also anther one that I had to re-watch the tutorial a few times to understand what I was doing.</p>

         </a>
            <p>The B-Roll project has been one of my favorite projects that I experimented with. I enjoyed shooting and editing video, and having access to this app really allowed me to dive into video editing. I chose to do this project around the feeling that every day is the same, especially when going through mental battles.</p>

         </a>
            <p>This interview that I conducted was about mental health coming from a college student's perspective. I interviewed my friend Lizzy about the various ways that mental health can affect a person, especially in college. She gave me the ideas that everyone experiences mental heatlh in different ways.</p>

                 </div>
        </a>
           <p>Animating a character was a fun experiment using Character Creator. It allowed me to see how animating a character is pretty simple, especially if you have access to a mic and camera. My lemon character was humourous and I may potentially create a more in detail character in the future.</p>

      <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left">With this round of creations, I was rreally able to do a lot more experimentation. I enjoyed creating editing videos and exploring the different forms of animation. I was able to come up with different creative concepts and come closer and closer to what my ideas were going to be for my final project. I challenged myself to keep going even whenever I could simply not figure out how certain tutorials worked. I struggled with some of the assignments, but I kept going and allowed my creativity to take over as much as I could. </p>
         <br>
            <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left">Throughout these couple of modules of work, I learned a lot from my classmates. While working in groups, my fellow classmates helped me workshop some of my ideas and helped me with any questions that had arised. At times I was able to figure out where I was going wrong with the help of others. Along with this, it was relieving talking to others about problems because I quickly learned that I was not the only one who struggled at times.</p>
          <br>
            <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left">For these projects, I really dived deep into mental health. I knew I wanted my final project to be about the combination of art and mental health, so I tried my best to put those ideas into every project I completed. For a lot of them, I thought about the end goal of this class, and I feel as though I learned a lot about the art of digital compostion. </p>
          <br>
                <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left">Building off of what I have said previously, some of these projects were a struggle for me to understand. A lot of the time I found myself in a frusterated spot because I could just not figure out what I was doing wrong. I would watch the posted tutorials and still question what was happening even though I was following it step by step. Eventually, I was able to figure out what I did wrong each time. I learned that the smallest move can cause the biggest impact. It's important to pay attention to detail and re-watch the tutorials as many times as needed to really understand wehre you go wrong.</p>
          <br>
                <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
      <p style="text-align: left">Presenting is a big part of this class, and I believe that presenting my own work, as well as seeing others' was beneficial to my time in the class. I made some works that I was proud of and I learned that presenting with others gives inspiration and allows for feedback to benefit future projects. It was very helpful to share and to recieve ideas and thoughts about exchanged topics.</p>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Throughout this course I had to really tap into my creative side and think outside of the box. I was able to achieve a lot of things that I never thought I could do, and put my self in a starting position to be able to create more in the future. I was able to present work that reflected my mind and allowed myself to show a lot of my creative personal work. It was nice to be able to display some of my art throughout some of these assignments. </p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Over the past 15 weeks I learned a lot about my peers within this class. I was able to find some classmates who related to my struggles and helped me feel less alone and less bad about not understanding some work 100%. Meeting new people and displaying my work for others to enjoy helped me want to do it more often. Sharing my art and some of the works that I was proud of encouraged me to keep going throughout the semster. </p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Coming up with new ideas is always a tricky thing to do when you're in a subject that you have no experience with; especially valid for me in this class. I was able to craft some things I never thought was imaginable and became familiar with different softwares. Some of them I forsee myself using in the future, espcially things like Premier Pro. Crafting in new ways in this class put me outside of my comfortzone and allowed me to create new experiences for myself and for my future. </p>

  <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This class really forced me to think in new and different ways. I had a to do a lot of problem solving and testing. Retrying and redoing was my specialty as I found myself having to do things over and over to truly figure them out. Although I did get frusterated at times, by the end I was always able to come up with something I did not think would be possible. Researching and watching videos and tutorials was crucial in this class. I spent a lot of time doing so and it really helped me understand things more throughly by the end. I now have knowledge in things that I didn't even know existed beforehand. </p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Some of my work throughout this class I was scared to present, and some of it I was happy to show off. It was a mixed bag throughout the semster, but by the end I was satisfied enough to show whatever I had, espeically after getting to know some of my peers. By the end of the semster I found myself showing others outside of the class my work because of the fact that it was so new and different to me. I was uneasy about how I did this semster, but looking back I think I deserve to be proud that I was able to make it to the end of the road. </p>
